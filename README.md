Cyber security in wireless connections can be a
subject difficult to handle after the volume of malware has
been increased extremely in recent years. which poses a serious
security threat to public institutions, businesses, and
individuals. In order to limit the preparation of malware, new
strategies are quickly identified and classify malware samples
that based on their behaviors. This research presents a deep
learning framework for malware for classifying different
malware families. To implement our classification method, we
used Malware color-based image (RBG) directly. Then the
malware images are identified and classified employing a
convolutional neural network (CNN) by extracting their features
automatically.Experiments on challenging malware classification
datasets, MaleVis, demonstrate that our model achieves better
performance than traditional machine learning models.The
model achieves 90.10% accuracy on the MaleVis datasets
